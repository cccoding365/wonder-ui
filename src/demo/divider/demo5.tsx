      I sit at my window this morning where the world like a passer-by stops for
      a moment, nods to me and goes.
      <Divider style={{ borderColor: '#c41d7f', color: '#c41d7f' }}>
        我是分割线
      </Divider>
      There little thoughts are the rustle of leaves; they have their whisper of
      joy in my mind.
    </div>
