      I sit at my window this morning where the world like a passer-by stops for a moment, nods to me and goes.
      <Divider />
      There little thoughts are the rustle of leaves; they have their whisper of joy in my mind.

      <Divider lineStyle="dotted" />
      There little thoughts are the rustle of leaves; they have their whisper of joy in my mind.

      <Divider lineStyle="dashed" />
      There little thoughts are the rustle of leaves; they have their whisper of joy in my mind.

      <Divider lineStyle="groove" />
      There little thoughts are the rustle of leaves; they have their whisper of joy in my mind.
